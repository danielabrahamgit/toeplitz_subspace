# Subspace Reconstruction With Toeplitz Embedding
This repository will show some examples of how to perform subspace reconstructions with toeplitz embedding. We demonstrate show two separate implimenations, one in Pytorch and one in Sigpy.

## In-Vivo MRF Data Example (Sigpy)  
 Here we use in-vivo MRF data, and then perform a subspace reconstruction with and without the toeplitz embedding. Make sure to download the data here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12IiApk8485EnmA0oe9doif9dg1oOxFOL?usp=share_link

## Simulated MRF Data Example (Sigpy) 
This notebook simulates an MRF acquisition, and then runs a reconstruction with and without toeplitz embeddings. No data needed, just run the notebook!
